# Call Center Performance - Dashboard

Creating a call center performance dashboard using Power BI and Excel can provide valuable insights into key metrics such as total call duration, average call duration and response time. Here's a list  of contents built in the dashboard:
- Home view
- Grid view
## Problem Statement
### Dashboard 1: Home
#### KPI's Reqiurement
#### 1. Total Number of Calls: 
We need to track and display the tital number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.
#### 2. Total Call Duration in Hours:
It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning.
#### 3. Total Call Duration in Minutes:
Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.

#### 4. Average Call Duration in Minutes: 
To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help Identify trends in call handling.

#### 5. Response Time Percentage: 
Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to-provide prompt service.

### Dashboard 2: Grid
- Create a Grid view dashboard displaying a table of all call details in Power BI.
- This should allow a user to export the grid for various filters applied. 
## Chart's Requirement

#### 1. Total Call by Day (Column Chart): 
Display a column chart that shows the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.

#### 2. Total Calls by State (Filled Map Chart): 
Create a filled map chart that visualizes the total number of calls received from different states or regions.

#### 3. Top Reason for Calls (Tree Map): 
Implement a tree map chart to display the top reasons for calls. Each box in the tree map represents a call reason.

#### 4. Total Calls by Channel (Donut Chart): 
Create a donut chart to showcase the distribution of calls by different communication channels.

#### 5. Total Calls by Sentiment (Column Chart): 
Utilize a column chart to illustrate the distribution of calls by sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

#### Total Calls by Call Center (Bar Chart): 
Create a bar chart that presents the total number of calls handled by e-call center or department.
## Steps Involved
